# QC4PySCF

Ground state energy calculator with PySCF & Qiskit 
Made by GM Kim 

Based on PySCF, Qiskit, Numpy 
 
Since Qiskit Nature is no longer supported, I decided to create a python module. 
Hopefully only people in my lab (TCCL) will use it. 
I've written the code to make it fairly easy to create ansatz or transform Hamiltonians, so feel free to use it as you wish.
